Steps to run the code:-

1. To run the code in jupyter notebook
	->first open jupyter notebook and open Santander.ipynb file in jupyter notebook
	->now import all the packages if packages are not installed then first install all the packages by  		
	using "pip install packagename" command.
	-> once imported all the packages now set the path where train and test datasets are saved.
	-> Now run all the codes by clicking shift+enter buttons together.

2. To run the code in R studio.
	->open Rstudio and open Santander.r file by going into files and then open
	->Now load all libraries. if libraries are not installed then first install libraries by using 		
	"install.packages("package name")" command.
	->Now after importing all the libraries set the path where train and test datasets are saved.
	->Now run all the code by clicking ctrl+enter buttons together.


*****************************To run the code from Dos prompt******************

1. To run the python code:-
	-> Either run Santander.py code or run Santander.ipynb
	-> To run Santander.py first open it and replace oschdir("path") with your path where you have stored 		
	the train and test data. Now open the terminal from the directory where your code is saved and type 		
	command "python3 Santander.py"
	->To run Santander.ipynb file first open terminal and install "runipy" by using following command 	
	"pip3 install runipy"
	-> Now open terminal and run "runipy -o Santander.ipynb"
2. To run R code from terminal:-
	-> Find the "littler" in repository and install it.
	-> Once installed litter package open Santander.R file and replace path from your path
	-> now open terminal from the location where you have stored the r code
	-> Now run command "Rscript Santander.r"

**********************************How to Deploy the model****************************

All the task done in jupyter or R might not be understandable to non-technical users or clients. So
we need to deploy the model for production using GUI. We can use two types of tool that is
Online(cloud) tools or offline tools.
	->In online tools we use cloud services where our R or Python code runs as a back end engine. And
	online tool takes output of R or python and presents it in Graphical format.
	->Similarly, in offline tools we use different programming languages like html,php,css for developing User Interface
	-> Our R our python code will be linked with this UI and will run as a back end engine.

	Interface. Our R our python code will be linked with this UI and will run as a back end engine.
	Output of R or Python code will be shown in Graphical format to users.



NOTE:-
if you are running R code in Rstudio with greater R version than 3.5.0 then lightgbm package will not install as usual
In this case please refer follwing steps.

Before installing LightGBM, install the following packages in R itself:

magrittr

R6

jsonlite

Once all the above is done, run with the git installation instructions as on the github page here

For those not able to access the link (or if it should move), the command are the following:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM

cd LightGBM

Rscript build_r.R
